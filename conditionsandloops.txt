Q1. What are conditional statements? Explain conditional statements with syntax and examples.
Ans- Conditional statement in JS or any other programming languages are those statements upon whoes execution the below mentioned statements are executed.
They can be if or switch . If the conditions are satisfied then the below statement will be executed else not.
Ex-
Let a =2 ;//It’s a number and if it’s a odd give an alert ODD
If(a%2 == 1){//if is a conditional statement upon whoes execution below statements will be true or false
alert(“ODD”)
}
Q2. Write a program that grades students based on their marks?
Ans-
const marks=80;
let grade="";
switch(true) {
    case (marks >90):
        grade="A";
        break;
    case (marks>70 && marks<90):
        grade="B";
        break;
    case (marks>50 && marks<70):
        grade="C";
        break;
    case (marks<50):
        grade="F";
        break;
}
console.log(grade)

Q3. What are loops, and what do we need them? Explain different types of loops with their syntax and
examples.
Ans- Loops are a fundamental concept in programming used to execute a block of code repeatedly based on a certain condition. They are crucial for automating repetitive tasks, iterating through collections of data, and performing operations until a specific condition is met.
For Loop: The for loop is used when you know in advance how many times you want to execute a block of code.
Ex- 
for (variable in array) {
  code
}
While Loop: The while loop is used when you want to execute a block of code as long as a condition is true.
Ex-
while (i < 10) {
  text += "The number is " + i;
  i++;
}Do-While Loop (Not available in Python): Unlike other loops, a do-while loop checks the condition after executing the block of code at least once. However, Python doesn’t have a built-in do-while loop, but similar functionality can be achieved using a while loop with a condition check at the beginning.
let text = "";
let i = 0;
do {
  text += i + "<br>";
  i++;
}
Q4. Generate n9mbers between any 2 given numbers.
Ex
Output: 11, 12, 13, ...., 25
Ans- let n1=10;
let n2=25;
let res="";
//res=n1;
while(n1<n2){
    res =  res+n1+","
     n1+=1;
 }
 res=res+n2
 console.log(res)
Q5. Use the while loop to print numbers from 1 to 25 in ascending and descending order.
Ans-
let n1=1;
let n2=25;
let res="";
while(n1<n2){
    res =  res+n1+","
     n1+=1;
 }
 res=res+n2
 console.log("ascending",res)
 res="";
 n1=1;
 n2=25;
 while(n1<n2){
    res =  res+n2+","
     n2-=1;
 }
 res=res+n1
 console.log("descending",res)
